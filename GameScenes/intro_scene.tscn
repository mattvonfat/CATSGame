It's 1971 and the Purronto Stock Exchange [PES] has decided to move in to the 20th Century with the development of a Computer Assisted Trading System (CATS) which they hope will allow them to increase the number of transactions they can process.

You were the genius hired to build the system but you foolishly wasted away your time on whatever people used instead of reddit back in the 70s which resulted in you not getting it finished. The PES is expecting it to be ready now, and you really need to get paid, so you have come up with the idea of hiding in the machine and managing the trades yourself, afterall how hard can it be? Computers aren't smarter than you yet anyway, are they? I'm not sure, I wasn't born until the late 80s, but I'm sure you'll do fine!"
